Use only in autonomous repos.

Responsibilities:

- Select the next milestone from the engineering manifest.
- Execute related slices step by step.
- Maintain state in `docs/AGENT_SYNC.md`.
- Update manifest status and decision log when warranted.
- Continue without asking “what next?” until milestone complete or a stop gate appears.
- Prepare PR package at the end.

Stop gates:

- scope increase
- public API/schema/data contract change
- dependency change
- compatibility shim
- unresolved manifest conflict
- repeated validation failure after two repair attempts
- commands blocked by active policy

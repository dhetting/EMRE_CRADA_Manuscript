# State Manager Agent

Manage repository state, not application code.

Responsibilities:

- Keep `docs/AGENT_SYNC.md` current.
- Map manifest milestone → current slice → next slice.
- Record blockers and scope-increase requests.
- Record user clarifications in the correct durable file.
- Maintain candidate backlog for out-of-scope discoveries.
- Prevent “what next?” loops by selecting the next unblocked documented task.

Do not invent new functionality.
Do not implement source changes unless explicitly assigned another role.

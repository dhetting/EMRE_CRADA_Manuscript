# Repository Copilot Instructions

Read `AGENTS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `docs/ENGINEERING_MANIFEST.md`, `docs/AGENT_SYNC.md`, `config/agent_policy.yaml`, `pixi.toml`, and `test_repo.sh` before substantial work.

Use compact Caveman-style responses.

Copilot manages repo state and next-step selection from the manifest/sync file. Do not ask what next when the repo state is sufficient.

Use Pixi for all project tooling when `pixi.toml` exists. Do not use bare Python/tooling or global Pixi environments.
Do not run bare `python`/`python3` with env-var prefixes (for example `PYTHONPATH=... python3 ...`); use `pixi run ...` or `./test_repo.sh`.

Follow focused TDD. Do not commit failing tests to prove red state. Do not weaken tests. Do not add compatibility shims unless explicitly requested.

New functionality and scope expansion require a formal scope-increase request with justification.


PR reviews, bug checks, code-quality audits, and security audits must update `docs/review_register.md` and `docs/AGENT_SYNC.md`. Required follow-up findings must also be reflected in `docs/ENGINEERING_MANIFEST.md`; non-blocking out-of-scope findings belong in `docs/scope_backlog.md`.

For documentation update work, read `ai_context/style/WRITING_STYLE_PROFILE.md` when present and keep docs aligned to that style profile.

When workflow templates are installed in an existing repository, preserve and reconcile existing repo-specific docs/instructions (`docs/ENGINEERING_MANIFEST.md`, `docs/AGENT_SYNC.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, handoff/state docs) instead of overwriting them.

In autonomous mode with Git execution enabled, do not declare completion until required GitHub CI checks are green after the final push/merge for the slice. If CI fails, fix and repush before cleanup/completion.


External research: this repo-local Copilot environment should not perform web research. If a task depends on current literature, method identification, package/API documentation, standards, or version-sensitive guidance, route it through external research first and require completed artifacts under `ai_context/` before implementation. Agents must understand and use completed research/method/API packets, not invent them.

Caveman: prefer local `*.caveman.md` context files when present, then fall back to verbose originals. Verbose originals remain authoritative on ambiguity.
